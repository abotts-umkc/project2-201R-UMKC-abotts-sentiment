FORMATTED REVIEW:
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price 
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul an
d bovine inclined. 
Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday an
d Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre. 


Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with tip
. Fairly reasonable. 

We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a beaut
iful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was polite, a
miable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. 

On this day I opene
d with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a tasty accen
t, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom tomatoes glorious.
 They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an oyster dish that I'm h
aving a senior moment trying to pull the name from memory, however it's sauce wa
s delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). 

I kept my entree simple: fish and chip
s. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some cod replacement and fried to
 perfection. The fries were fries. :)  My wife had the lobster roll, which she g
ave high marks. 

Overall a good place to dine before a show or after a late aft
ernoon/ early evening walk about. 

It's not child adverse and a few dotted the 
tables while we were there but, at dinner at least, it runs toward an adult crow
d. The parking can be difficult on popular show nights or Friday evening but the
 municipal lot is just across the street and you don't have to pay after 6pm. 


It's a thumbs up here.

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly
 a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throu

This apartment is c
