update 2 currently still sunday 10/8 at 12:55 am

i did it !!! 

the file directories i updated with the individual txt files 
and i put the final touches on the code functionality 

ahhh i am so happy with my work here 

i worked on this file for a total of about 20 hours 

i had to do a lot of research into errors i was getting and how to fix them 
im pretty proud of myself 

currently sunday 10/8 at 12:18 am 
one problem i know i need to fix is that the files are coded to recognize my local file names 
i need to push one with just review1.txt for example because they all have a direct path on my computer right now 
program fully works to my awareness 

here is an example from my program running currently from my local files for reviewsPart2.txt 
PROCESSING FILE: review4.txt

FORMATTED REVIEW:
Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home rig
ht away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and he
 is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly recomm
end!
It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't look very
 fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's pretty eas
y to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train w
hich goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded
 and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend t
his place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there 
in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest weeks for la
st year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm!
"I had the most 
beautiful stay,
Garon is a very special person and an absolute angel, made me fe
el totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed environment,
I throughly rec
ommend Bliss Art Space!
